Usage
-----

First specify a document class in the top of the TeX document.

``` tex
\documentclass[]{jletteraddress}
```

Then, describe the sender's informations (name, postcode, and address)
in the preamble as following:

``` tex
\sendername{Taro Sender}                   % Sender's name
\senderaddressa{1-2-3, Sender-city, Japan} % Sender's address 1
\senderaddressb{#999 Sender Mansion}       % Sender's address 2
\senderpostcode{9999999}                   % Sender's postcode
```

Now you can add the receiver's information in the document.  To add the
receiver's information, use `\addaddress` macro to specify the
receiver's name, postcode, and address between `\begin{document}` and
`\end{document}`.

``` tex
\begin{document}
  \addaddress
      {Receiver name}
      {Receiver prefix}
      {Receiver postcode}
      {Receiver address 1}
      {Receiver address 2}
\end{document}
```
